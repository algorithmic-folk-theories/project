## About the Project

This project brings together academic researchers and digital content creators to identify and analyze folk theories regarding algorithmic content curation and moderation on TikTok in order to identify opportunities and strategies for combating the spread of mis/disinformation and hate speech on the platform. Upon gathering these folk theories, the project team, which is composed of both academics and community members, will synthesize them with extant academic theory and methodologies to identify potential points of overlap and generate cross-professional vocabularies that facilitate trust and understanding for future ethical collaborations between experts and non-academics in the field of algorithm studies. We seek to not only aggregate folk knowledge, but use critical and computational analysis to investigate and come to conclusions about how that knowledge is generated. We seek to not only make connections between academics and content creators, but forge pathways that establish long-term collaborations.

## Principles of Collaboration and Partnership 
This project is a collaboration between the Lincoln Center of Applied Ethics (LCAE) at Arizona State University (asu) and the Online Content Creator Association (OCCA). The project partners on the current incarnation of this project (see ___) have co-designed the below care-based principles of collaboration, which are included in a Memorandum of Understanding dated November 2023.

- Collaborators will seek to provide intellectual and professional support, as well as compassion and understanding, to each other.
- Open lines of communication will be maintained on several platforms, but especially via the project Discord server, among the entire team and throughout the course of this MOU term.
- Collaborators will be flexible with each other and with community members, prioritizing care for self and others. 
- Failure is an option, i.e. it is acceptable that our original theories are incorrect and that our path to completion evolves over the course of the project.
- Redundancy, cross-training, and revision of approach and/or deliverables will be the preferred methods for managing risk and making space for collaborators to attend to their lives and livelihoods.
- Compensation for time and labor is an essential component of this project, for team members, and for stakeholders/project participants.
- All collaborators will prioritize and make space for vulnerability, honesty, and transparency in co-design spaces, with each other, and with project stakeholders.
- We will intentionally engage and make room for creativity, play, and whimsy, both in our process and products. 
- We will produce a chart detailing roles and responsibilities to create transparency around those impacted by approaching deadlines. 

## Goals and Outcomes, 2023-2024
The goal of this collaboration is to produce a final product that is open to further extension and work, and the continuation of this collaboration is an anticipated final outcome. 

The final outcomes of this collaboration will:
- produce publicly available, legible, and accessible outcomes in accordance with the grant;
publish nuanced academic publications that detail folk knowledge produced and circulated by content creators regarding TikTok’s algorithmic governance, how that knowledge was created, and how it relates to established academic knowledge and methods;
- generate and make public new understandings and/or definitions of experiential knowledge, beyond confessional or anecdotal evidence by emphasizing theory;
- create a “shared vocabulary” across personal/professional and academic/non-academic spaces to be used as tools for advocacy and future collaboration(s);
- design an interface (metaphorically and via the project website) that emphasizes multiple ways of knowing and documents where knowledge systems overlap by identifying points of contact and shared vocabularies;
- be accessible, both in terms of open access products and as formats that fit our intended audience(s);
- visible to OCCA members in methods and forms that clearly demonstrate value to community stakeholders;
- address our many audiences and stakeholders, currently defined as but not perpetually limited to: OCCA, scholarly researchers working in Science and Technology Studies/Science, Technology, and Society, general public members interested in TikTok, policy makers;
- expand established methodology of Project Management and Care, developed by Liz Grumbach and Erica O’Neil (ASU);
- empower citizen science scholars and creators;
- create a networking of stakeholders that care and a meaningful partnership that is a true collaboration between institutions (OCCA and LCAE).

## History of the project
Collaborations between the LCAE and OCCA, formerly The Online Creators’ Association (TOCA) began in 2020, when the ASU team invited T.X. Watson to give a talk on "Examining TikTok," specifically on algorithmic content curation, moderation, and algorithmic bias on the platform. Our first co-designed output was the “Experiences on TikTok” panel series, a co-hosted series of conversations amongst historically marginalized creators that discussed the opportunities and challenges of content creation and algorithmic bias. This series allowed us to grow our network and cross-institutional trust, resulting in three co-authored grant proposals (unfunded, NSF-AISL and ACLS; funded, NEH-ODH). 

## Team Members and Partners

- OCCA: The Online Content Creator Association is a creator-led advocacy group fighting to improve labor conditions for online content creators. 

- LCAE: The Lincoln Center for Applied Ethics at Arizona State University is a research organization empowering students, faculty, entrepreneurs, and the community to examine the impact of technologies in our lives with the goal of designing a future keyed to human flourishing.`
